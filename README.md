# MovieTheatreTicketReservation

Created a Movie Theatre Ticket Reservation desktop application using Java, Swing/AWT and MySQL.

This was a final project for the ENSF480 - Principles of Software Design course. 

The application uses an MVC design pattern as well as a singleton pattern. Users are able to select a movie, movie theatre, seats and purchase tickets. Registered users with accounts have additional bonus features exclusive to them. 

To run this app, compile all .class source files into a JAR file and run.

Completed by Manraj Singh, Sajan Hayer, Krishna Shah and Jacob Adeyemo.
